<h2>news mode</h2>
<p>In the news mode, you can input the date and get the news at the day. In the source code, I use the NEWSAPI which response the news info. However, due to the pricing of API, you can use this mode in the local host, so you can download a zip, then npm install, and command "npm run dev" to use the news mode</p>
